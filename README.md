# Ethereum Development with Go
Develop Ethereum Application using the Go programming language.

## [Solidity](https://github.com/truongnmt/go-ethereum/tree/master/solidity)
Solidity is a Turing complete programming language for writing smart contracts. Solidity gets compiled to bytecode which is what the Ethereum virtual machine executes.

## go-ethereum
We'll be using the go-ethereum, the official Ethereum implementation in Go, to interact with the blockchain. Go-ethereum, also known as geth for short, is the most popular Ethereum client and because it's in Go, it provides everything we'll ever need for reading and writing to the blockchain when developing applications using Golang.

## [Smart-contracts](https://github.com/truongnmt/go-ethereum/tree/master/smart_contracts)
